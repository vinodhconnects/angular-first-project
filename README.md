### Angular Directives

    The custom html elements and custom attributes that we create in angular
    are called angular Directives

    there are three kinds of Directives in Angular

* Component Directives
* Structural Directives
* Attribute Directives

#### Component Directives

  Every component that we create is a custom html element

  EVery component that you create is a component directive

#### Structural Directives

   Structural Directives generate html template, hides/unhides the template

   Basically Structural directives manipulate the layout[html]

   There are few inbuilt stuructural directies

   ```
      Example: ngFor, ngIf, ngSwitch
   ```

   We can also create our own custom structural directives

   Note: while using structural directives we must prefix them with asterisk(*)
